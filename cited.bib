  abstract = {Rigidity, arising in discrete geometry, is the property of a structure that does not flex. Laman provides a combinatorial characterization of rigid graphs in the Euclidean plane, and thus rigid graphs in the Euclidean plane have applications in graph theory. We discover a sufficient partition condition of packing spanning rigid subgraphs and spanning trees. As a corollary, we show that a simple graph \$G\$ contains a packing of \$k\$ spanning rigid subgraphs and \$l\$ spanning trees if \$G\$ is \$(4k+2l)\$-edge-connected, and \$G-Z\$ is essentially \$(6k+2l - 2k{\textbar}Z{\textbar})\$-edge-connected for every \$Z{\textbackslash}subset V(G)\$. Thus every \$(4k+2l)\$-connected and essentially \$(6k+2l)\$-connected graph \$G\$ contains a packing of \$k\$ spanning rigid subgraphs and \$l\$ spanning trees. Utilizing this, we show that every \$6\$-connected and essentially \$8\$-connected graph \$G\$ contains a spanning tree \$T\$ such that \$G-E(T)\$ is \$2\$-connected. These improve some previous results. Sparse subgraph covering problems are also studied.},

It is known that the family of the edge sets of \$(k,{\textbackslash}ell)\$-sparse subgraphs forms the family of independent sets of a matroid, called the \$(k,{\textbackslash}ell)\$-count matroid of \$G\$. In this paper we shall investigate lifts of the \$(k,{\textbackslash}ell)\$-count matroid by using group labelings on the edge set. By introducing a new notion called near-balancedness, we shall identify a new class of matroids, where the independence condition is described as a count condition of the form \${\textbar}F{\textbar}{\textbackslash}leq k{\textbar}V(F){\textbar}-{\textbackslash}ell +{\textbackslash}alpha\_\{{\textbackslash}psi\}(F)\$ for some function \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{{\textbackslash}psi\}\$ determined by a given group labeling \${\textbackslash}psi\$ on \$E\$.},

The strong analogies (sometimes isomorphisms) between generic rigidity matroids and generic cofactor matroids is one central theme of the chapter. We emphasize matroidal results for the combinatorial ‘generic’ situations, with geometric techniques used when they contribute combinatorial insights. A second basic theme is the analysis of represented matroids using the duality of row and column dependencies of the representing matrix (generalizing statics and kinematics in rigidity).},
